# Application Subscription Trend Analysis and Churn Prediction
This project aims to analyze application subscription trends and predict churn using machine learning models. We explore key features influencing customer retention and develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn. The repository contains the Python code for the machine learning model as well as a Tableau dashboard visualizing key trends.

1. **Project Overview**
   Customer churn prediction is essential for subscription-based businesses to maintain customer retention and minimize revenue loss. This project leverages customer data to build a predictive model for identifying at-risk customers and explores patterns and trends in customer subscriptions.
